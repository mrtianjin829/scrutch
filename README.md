# Scrutch
**⚠️ Project is discontinued**
## About this Project
Scrutch is an incomplete WIP (work in progress) project that tries to transpile JS-like code into Scratch codeblocks. It mainly works around the `project.json` file and could be compatible with proper Scratch mods

## Requirements

- Web browser for testing Scratch
- Node.js + Typescript package (typescript,tsc)

## Current usage:

```
node dist/index.js path/to/project.json
```

Output: Modified project.json file put to `stdout` instead of writing
